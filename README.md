# Quantitative Math Learning Portfolio

This repository documents the structured consolidation and progressive deepening of quantitative foundations supporting graduate studies in finance and long-term development in portfolio and asset management.

The objective is to reinforce mathematical rigor and analytical reasoning applied to investment analysis, risk management, and structured decision-making in financial markets.

## Objective

Holding a Bachelor’s degree in Physics, I developed strong foundations in mathematics, analytical modeling, and scientific reasoning.

This repository reflects a structured refresher and progressive extension of key quantitative concepts, beginning with Linear Algebra  to ensure rigor and alignment with financial applications.

The focus is consolidation, refinement, and long-term intellectual continuity within a financial context.

## Roadmap – Progressive Quantitative Development

The roadmap below outlines a structured long-term plan for strengthening quantitative foundations in support of portfolio and asset management.

Only active modules are developed at a given time.

| Theme | Core Objective | Financial Application | Status |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Linear Algebra** | Matrix operations, eigenvalues, SVD | PCA, covariance matrices, risk factor analysis | In progress |
| Differential Calculus | Gradients, optimization principles | Sensitivity analysis, portfolio optimization | Planned |
| Probability & Statistics | Uncertainty modeling, inference | Risk estimation, return distributions | Planned |
| Optimization Methods | Constrained optimization | Asset allocation, efficient frontier | Long-term objective |
| Stochastic Methods | Random processes, diffusion models | Volatility concepts, option pricing foundations | Long-term objective |

---

This repository evolves progressively as modules are completed and documented.
